## apae_website 🌟

A small static website for a local NGO-like project. This repository contains simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript files meant to be opened directly in a browser (no build step).

## About 📝

This project is a static website that serves basic pages for a small organisation: home, about, contact and donation information. It was built with plain HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.

## Files in this repository 📁

- `index.html` – Homepage
- `about.html` – About page
- `contact.html` – Contact page
- `doar.html` – Donation / support page
- `files.html` – Files or resources page
- `main.js` – JavaScript examples / interactivity
- `style.css` – Main stylesheet
- `assets/` – Images, icons and other static assets

## Quick start 🚀

Open the site locally in your browser — no server required:

1. In Windows Explorer, double-click `index.html`.
2. Or from your terminal (PowerShell), run:

```powershell
# open index.html in default browser (PowerShell)
Start-Process -FilePath 'index.html'
```

If you prefer a lightweight local server (recommended when testing fetch/XHR):

```powershell
# serve current folder on port 8000 using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Notes about the code 💡

- This is a static site: there is no build tool or Node dependency.
- `main.js` contains the project's JavaScript. You can open the browser console to see example logs and test small scripts.
- The CSS is in `style.css`; edit it to change look & feel.

## Contact / Help ✉️

If you want help adding interactive JS examples or a small README in Portuguese, tell me and I can:

- add interactive console examples inside `main.js`
- add an `index.html` demo section with buttons to run those examples
- add a Portuguese version of this README

Happy coding! 🎉
